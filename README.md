# NBA Rookie Success Prediction Model

This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict the success of a rookie in the NBA after 5 years. 
## Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset that includes historical data of NBA players along with their performance and metrics in their rookie season. The dataset contains features such as points per game, rebounds per game, assists per game, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before running the prediction model, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python or Anaconda
- Pandas (version 1.4.2)
- Scikit (version 1.0.2)
- NumPy (version 1.21.5)

## Model Evaluation

The performance of the NBA rookie success prediction model can be evaluated using the 'accuracy_score' method from the scikit library.
